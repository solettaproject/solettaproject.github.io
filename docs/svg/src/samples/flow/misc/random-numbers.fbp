# This file will print random numbers as integers, float, bytes or
# boolean to the standard output.
#
# Note that the same seed generates the same sequence, thus the
# sequence is predictable given the seed is discovered.
#
# Use this module only to do some testing that need a repeatable
# sequence of random numbers, otherwise find a good entropy source to
# provide the seed.
