# This example prints the state (attached / dettached) of a device
# defined on options of node "dev" (in this case a sdcard).
# If you don't have a clue about what is the path for your device,
# you may try udevadm monitor and see what is added / removed.

# TODO wouldn't it be useful to receive address via input ports?
