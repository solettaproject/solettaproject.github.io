# Soletta Documentation Autogenerated Repository

**AUTOGENERATED DOCUMENTATION!!**

Most probably you don't want to fork this repository
or open pull requests for it.

Instead you should change the source of the documentation:
 * If its's about Soletta Machine Learning use [SML repo](https://github.com/solettaproject/soletta-machine-learning)
 * If it's Soletta itself (cheat sheet included) use [Soletta repo](https://github.com/solettaproject/soletta)


A bot is always pushing an up to date documentation with `git push -f`

Thanks
